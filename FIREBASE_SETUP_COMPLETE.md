firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Next Steps:

1. Implement authentication in frontend and mobile apps
2. Create user registration flows
3. Build service provider profiles
4. Implement service request creation and tracking
5. Build the provider matching system
6. Create admin dashboard
7. Test provider location tracking

For complete details on the data model and rules, refer to the Firebasesetup.md document.

## Google Maps Integration:

When building location features, you'll need to:
1. Get a Google Maps API key from the Google Cloud Console
2. Restrict the API key to your domain and apps
3. Add the key to your frontend and mobile apps

The Firebase Functions are already set up to support location-based services.
